      Welcome to GiTrip. By accessing and using this website and its services, you agree to
      comply with and be bound by the following terms of use, which together with our
      <a href="/ui/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> govern our relationship with you in relation
      to this website.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      GiTrip is a web-based trip-planning platform. You may use the service to create,
      edit, and share travel itineraries. You may use the Quick Route feature and browse
      public trips without creating an account. An account is required to save trips,
      collaborate with others, and manage your itineraries.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Account Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
      of your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to
      provide accurate information during registration and to keep your account details
      up to date.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Content</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of any content you create on GiTrip, including trip plans,
      itineraries, and any other data you submit. By setting a trip to "public", you
      grant other users permission to view and fork that trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to upload content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive,
      or otherwise objectionable.
    </p>

      the respective terms of those services.
